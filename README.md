## üìå Description
Fair-y, a fairs management system developed to facilitate the process of managing fairs in terms of finding participants and offering tickets. The platform is built with MERN stack and has three interfaces, one for the admin to manage fairs, another for attendees to book tickets for active fairs, and the last for exhibitors who wish to participate in fairs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

A first step for Fair-y project to see the light was planning, a critical stage to guide development. It mainly resulted in:

- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: the main guide of schema and database managment. <br>
